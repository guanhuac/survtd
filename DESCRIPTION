Description: Fit the Cox proportional hazards model or the semi-parametric additive hazards 
             model with time-fixed covariates of any type and continuous time-dependent covariates 
             subject to measurement error, missing data, or simply observed in discrete time: these 
             issues are all handled with a two-stage joint modelling approach using multiple imputation 
             (see Moreno-Betancur et al. 2016). The package also provides a naive two-stage approach 
             (Naive2S, for comparison) and an easy-to-use implementation of the last observation carried 
             forward (LOCF) approach which is the traditional method to incoporate time-dependent 
             covariates of any type in hazard models. Data simulation functions also included.
