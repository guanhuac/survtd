Description: Fit semi-parametric Cox or additive hazards regression models with time-
             fixed covariates of any type and multiple continuous time-dependent covariates 
             subject to missing data, measurement error or simply observed in discrete time: 
             all these issues are handled with the two-stage Multiple Imputation for
             Joint Modeling (MIJM) approach developed by Moreno-Betancur et al. (2017). 
             The package also provides easy-to-use implementations of an unadapted version
             (unMIJM); a simple two-stage approach (simple2S), based on single imputation 
             of the continuous markers from linear mixed models; and the last observation 
             carried forward (LOCF) approach for time-dependent covariates of any type, 
             which is the traditional method to incoporate these in hazard models. 
             Data simulation functions also included.
